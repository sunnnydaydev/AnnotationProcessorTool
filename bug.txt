1、com/squareup/javapoet/TypeName

* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> com/squareup/javapoet/TypeName

* Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output. Run with --scan to get full insights.

Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/squareup/javapoet/TypeName
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.squareup.javapoet.TypeName

 
解决：implementation 换为api 

implementation 'com.squareup:javapoet:1.12.1'

 api 'com.squareup:javapoet:1.12.1'

2、Annotation processors must be explicitly declared now.

解决：gradle中添加如下

javaCompileOptions { annotationProcessorOptions { includeCompileClasspath = true } }
        //Annotation processors must be explicitly declared now. The following dependencies on the compile classpath are found to contain annotation processor.
